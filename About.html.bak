            <p>
                These produce needs proper atmosphere to preserve its quality.
                They are stored at our own warehouses to eradicate moisture and improve their quality.

            <h3>Direct Purchase</h3>
            <p>
                We purchase Onion, Maize and Other Foodgrains directly from the farmers in an auction organised by
                the market committee. It is the first and basic level where the farm produce initially lands.
                Hence we have a Direct Interaction with the Producer of the product.
                The product hence lands fresh in our warehouses with no human intervention.
